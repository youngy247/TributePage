## 7.2 - Steven Gerrard Tribute Page

I chose to Steven Gerrard to make a tribute page for as he was my childhood hero.
I enjoyed this task as it allowed me to look back on his career and learn about his career that I didn't know about.

This task also enabled me to learn practically how to use:

- Flexbox to have 3 YouTube videos side by side and 2 lists of achievements
- How to correctly link a YouTube video
- How to group and a Title to a YouTube video
- How to correctly center elements
- To put as much styling as possible with the body and main selectors to remove repeated code
